IMPORTANT: The examples on this page demonstrate the output produced by the built-in HTML converter. An AsciiDoc converter is expected to produce complementary output when generating other output formats, such as PDF, EPUB, and DocBook.

== Paragraphs

=== example1

Paragraphs don't require special markup in AsciiDoc.
A paragraph is defined by one or more consecutive lines of text.
Line breaks within a paragraph are not displayed.

Leave at least one empty line to begin a new paragraph.

=== example2

A normal paragraph.

 A literal paragraph.
 One or more consecutive lines indented by at least one space.

 The text is shown in a fixed-width (typically monospace) font.
 The lines are preformatted (i.e., as formatted in the source).
 Spaces and newlines,
 like the ones in this sentence,
 are preserved.

=== example3

Roses are red, +
violets are blue.

[%hardbreaks]
A ruby is red.
Java is black.

=== Example 4. Lead paragraph
[.lead]
This text will be styled as a lead paragraph (i.e., larger font).

This paragraph will not be.

TIP: The default Asciidoctor stylesheet automatically styles the first paragraph of the preamble as a lead paragraph if no role is specified on that paragraph.

== Text formatting

=== Example 5. Constrained bold, italic, and monospace

It has *strong* significance to me.

I _cannot_ stress this enough.

Type `OK` to accept.

That *_really_* has to go.

Can't pick one? Let's use them `*_all_*`.

=== Example 6. Unconstrained bold, italic, and monospace
**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete (CRUD)

That's fan__freakin__tastic!

Don't pass generic ``Object``s to methods that accept ``String``s!

It was Beatle**__mania__**!

=== Example 7. Highlight, underline, strikethrough, and custom role
Werewolves are allergic to #cinnamon#.

##Mark##up refers to text that contains formatting ##mark##s.

Where did all the [.underline]#cores# go?

We need [.line-through]#ten# twenty VMs.

A [.myrole]#custom role# must be fulfilled by the theme.

=== Example 8. Superscript and subscript
^super^script phrase

~sub~script phrase

=== Example 9. Smart quotes and apostrophes
"`double curved quotes`"

'`single curved quotes`'

Olaf's desk was a mess.

A ``std::vector```'s size is the number of items it contains.

All of the werewolves`' desks were a mess.

Olaf had been with the company since the `'00s.

== Links
=== Example 10. Autolinks, URL macro, and mailto macro
https://asciidoctor.org - automatic!

https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]

devel@discuss.example.org

mailto:devel@discuss.example.org[Discuss]

mailto:join@discuss.example.org[Subscribe,Subscribe me,I want to join!]

=== Example 11. URL macros with attributes
https://discuss.asciidoctor.org[Discuss Asciidoctor,role=external,window=_blank]

https://discuss.asciidoctor.org[Discuss Asciidoctor^]

IMPORTANT: The link: macro prefix is not required when the target starts with a URL scheme like https:. The URL scheme acts as an implicit macro prefix.

CAUTION: If the link text contains a comma and the text is followed by one or more named attributes, you must enclose the text in double quotes. Otherwise, the text will be cut off at the comma (and the remaining text will get pulled into the attribute parsing).

=== Example 12. URLs with spaces and special characters
link:++https://example.org/?q=[a b]++[URL with special characters]

https://example.org/?q=%5Ba%20b%5D[URL with special characters]

=== Example 13. Link to relative file
link:index.html[Docs]

=== Example 14. Link using a Windows UNC path
link:\\server\share\whitepaper.pdf[Whitepaper]

=== Example 15. Inline anchors
[[bookmark-a]]Inline anchors make arbitrary content referenceable.

[#bookmark-b]#Inline anchors can be applied to a phrase like this one.#

anchor:bookmark-c[]Use a cross reference to link to this location.

[[bookmark-d,last paragraph]]The xreflabel attribute will be used as link text in the cross-reference link.

=== Example 16. Cross references
See <<paragraphs>> to learn how to write paragraphs.

Learn how to organize the document into <<section-titles,sections>>.

=== Example 17. Inter-document cross references
Refer to xref:document-b.adoc#section-b[Section B of Document B] for more information.

If you never return from xref:document-b.adoc[Document B], we'll send help.
Document header
The document header is optional. The header may not contain any empty lines and must be separated from the content by at least one empty line.

=== Example 18. Title

= Document Title

This document provides...

== Example 19. Title and author line
= Document Title
Author Name <author@email.org>; Author Name <author@email.org>

This document provides...


== Example 20. Title, author line, and revision line
= Document Title
Author Name <author@email.org>
v2.0, 2019-03-22

This document provides...
You cannot have a revision line without an author line.

== Example 21. Document header with attribute entries
= Document Title
Author Name <author@email.org>
v2.0, 2019-03-22
:toc:
:homepage: https://example.org

This document provides...
Section titles
When the document type is article (the default), the document can only have one level 0 section title (=), which is the document title (i.e., doctitle).

== Example 22. Article section levels
= Document Title (Level 0)

== Level 1 Section Title

=== Level 2 Section Title

==== Level 3 Section Title

===== Level 4 Section Title

====== Level 5 Section Title

== Another Level 1 Section Title

The book document type can have additional level 0 section titles, which are interpreted as parts. The presence of at least one part implicitly makes the document a multi-part book.

=== Example 23. Book section levels
= Document Title (Level 0)

== Level 1 Section Title

= Level 0 Section Title (Part)

== Level 1 Section Title

=== Level 2 Section Title

==== Level 3 Section Title

===== Level 4 Section Title

====== Level 5 Section Title

= Another Level 0 Section Title (Part)

=== Example 24. Discrete heading (not a section)
[discrete]
=== I'm an independent heading!
== Automatic TOC

=== Example 25. Activate Table of Contents for a document
= Document Title
Doc Writer <doc.writer@email.org>
:toc:
The Table of Content’s title, displayed section depth, and position can be customized.

== Includes

=== Example 26. Include document parts

= Reference Documentation
Lead Developer

This is documentation for project X.

include::basics.adoc[]

include::installation.adoc[]

include::example.adoc[]

=== Example 27. Include content by tagged regions or lines
include::filename.txt[tag=definition]

include::filename.txt[lines=5..10]

=== Example 28. Include content from a URL
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/main/README.adoc[]

WARNING: Including content from a URL is potentially dangerous, so it’s disabled if the safe mode is SECURE or greater. Assuming the safe mode is less than SECURE, you must also set the allow-uri-read attribute to permit the AsciiDoc processor to read content from a URL.

== Lists

=== Example 29. Unordered list
* List item
** Nested list item
*** Nested list item
* List item
 ** Another nested list item
* List item


TIP: An empty line is required before and after a list to separate it from other blocks. You can force two adjacent lists apart by adding an empty attribute list (i.e., []) above the second list or by inserting an empty line followed by a line comment after the first list. If you use a line comment, the convention is to use //- to provide a hint to other authors that it’s serving as a list divider.

=== Example 30. Unordered list max level nesting
* Level 1 list item
** Level 2 list item
*** Level 3 list item
**** Level 4 list item
***** Level 5 list item
* Level 1 list item


The unordered list marker can be changed using a list style (e.g., square).


=== Example 31. Ordered list
. Step 1
. Step 2
.. Step 2a
.. Step 2b
. Step 3



=== Example 32. Ordered list max level nesting
. Level 1 list item
.. Level 2 list item
... Level 3 list item
.... Level 4 list item
..... Level 5 list item
. Level 1 list item


Ordered lists support numeration styles such as lowergreek and decimal-leading-zero.


=== Example 33. Checklist
* [*] checked
* [x] also checked
* [ ] not checked
* normal list item



=== Example 34. Description list
First term:: The description can be placed on the same line
as the term.
Second term::
Description of the second term.
The description can also start on its own line.



=== Example 35. Question and answer list
[qanda]
What is the answer?::
This is the answer.

Have you seen my duck?:: No.



=== Example 36. Mixed
Operating Systems::
  Linux:::
    . Fedora
      * Desktop
    . Ubuntu
      * Desktop
      * Server
  BSD:::
    . FreeBSD
    . NetBSD

Cloud Providers::
  PaaS:::
    . OpenShift
    . CloudBees
  IaaS:::
    . Amazon EC2
    . Rackspace


TIP: Lists can be indented. Leading whitespace is not significant.

=== Example 37. Complex content in outline lists
* Every list item has at least one paragraph of content,
  which may be wrapped, even using a hanging indent.
+
Additional paragraphs or blocks are adjoined by putting
a list continuation on a line adjacent to both blocks.
+
list continuation:: a plus sign (`{plus}`) on a line by itself

* A literal paragraph does not require a list continuation.

 $ cd projects/my-book

* AsciiDoc lists may contain any complex content.
+
|===
|Column 1, Header Row |Column 2, Header Row

|Column 1, Row 1
|Column 2, Row 1
|===


== Images
You can use the imagesdir attribute to avoid hard coding the common path to your images in every image macro. The value of this attribute can be an absolute path, relative path, or base URL. If the image target is a relative path, the attribute’s value is prepended (i.e., it’s resolved relative to the value of the imagesdir attribute). If the image target is a URL or absolute path, the attribute’s value is not prepended.


=== Example 38. Block image macro
image::sunset.jpg[]

image::sunset.jpg[Sunset]

.A mountain sunset
[#img-sunset]
[caption="Figure 1: ",link=https://www.flickr.com/photos/javh/5448336655]
image::sunset.jpg[Sunset,200,100]

image::https://asciidoctor.org/images/octocat.jpg[GitHub mascot]


Two colons following the image keyword in the macro (i.e., image::) indicates a block image (aka figure), whereas one colon following the image keyword (i.e., image:) indicates an inline image. (All macros follow this pattern). You use an inline image when you need to place the image in a line of text. Otherwise, you should prefer the block form.


=== Example 39. Inline image macro
Click image:play.png[] to get the party started.

Click image:pause.png[title="Pause"] when you need a break.



=== Example 40. Inline image macro with positioning role
image:sunset.jpg[Sunset,150,150,role=right] What a beautiful sunset!



=== Example 41. Embedded
= Document Title
:data-uri:
When the data-uri attribute is set, all images in the document—​including admonition icons—​are embedded into the document as data URIs. You can also pass it as a command line argument using -a data-uri.

== Audio

=== Example 42. Block audio macro
audio::ocean-waves.wav[]

audio::ocean-waves.wav[start=60,opts=autoplay]
You can control the audio settings using additional attributes and options on the macro.

== Videos

=== Example 43. Block video macro
video::video-file.mp4[]

video::video-file.mp4[width=640,start=60,opts=autoplay]

=== Example 44. Embedded YouTube video
video::RvRhUHTV_8k[youtube]

=== Example 45. Embedded Vimeo video
video::67480300[vimeo]
You can control the video settings using additional attributes and options on the macro.

== Keyboard, button, and menu macros
IMPORTANT: You must set the experimental attribute in the document header to enable these macros.

=== Example 46. Keyboard macro
|===
|Shortcut |Purpose

|kbd:[F11]
|Toggle fullscreen

|kbd:[Ctrl+T]
|Open a new tab
|===




=== Example 47. Menu macro
To save the file, select menu:File[Save].

Select menu:View[Zoom > Reset] to reset the zoom level to the default setting.




=== Example 48. Button macro
Press the btn:[OK] button when you are finished.

Select a file in the file navigator and click btn:[Open].




== Literals and source code

=== Example 49. Inline literal monospace
Output literal monospace text, such as `+{backtick}+` or `+http://localhost:8080+`, by enclosing the text in a pair of pluses surrounded by a pair backticks.



=== Example 50. Literal paragraph
Normal line.

 Indent line by one space to create a literal line.

Normal line.



=== Example 51. Literal block
....
error: 1954 Forbidden search
absolutely fatal: operation lost in the dodecahedron of doom

Would you like to try again? y/n
....



=== Example 52. Listing block with title
.Gemfile.lock
----
GEM
  remote: https://rubygems.org/
  specs:
    asciidoctor (2.0.15)

PLATFORMS
  ruby

DEPENDENCIES
  asciidoctor (~> 2.0.15)
----



=== Example 53. Source block with title and syntax highlighting
.Some Ruby code
[source,ruby]
----
require 'sinatra'

get '/hi' do
  "Hello World!"
end
----


IMPORTANT: You must enable source highlighting by setting the source-highlighter attribute in the document header, CLI, or API.

:source-highlighter: rouge
See Syntax Highlighting to learn which values are accepted when using Asciidoctor.


=== Example 54. Source block with callouts
[source,ruby]
----
require 'sinatra' // <1>

get '/hi' do // <2>
  "Hello World!" // <3>
end
----
<1> Library import
<2> URL mapping
<3> HTTP response body



=== Example 55. Make callouts non-selectable
----
line of code // <1>
line of code # <2>
line of code ;; <3>
line of code <!--4-->
----
<1> A callout behind a line comment for C-style languages.
<2> A callout behind a line comment for Ruby, Python, Perl, etc.
<3> A callout behind a line comment for Clojure.
<4> A callout behind a line comment for XML or SGML languages like HTML.



=== Example 56. Source block content included from a file
[source,ruby]
----
include::app.rb[]
----

=== Example 57. Source block content included from file relative to source directory
:sourcedir: src/main/java

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/asciidoctor/Asciidoctor.java[]
----

=== Example 58. Strip leading indentation from partial file content
[source,ruby]
----
include::lib/app.rb[tag=main,indent=0]
----
NOTE: The indent attribute is frequently used when including source code by tagged region or lines. It can be specified on the include directive itself or the enclosing literal, listing, or source block.

When indent is 0, the leading block indent is stripped.

When indent is greater than 0, the leading block indent is first stripped, then a block is indented by the number of columns equal to this value.


=== Example 59. Source paragraph (no empty lines)
[source,xml]
<meta name="viewport"
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

This is normal content.


== Admonitions

=== Example 60. Admonition paragraph
NOTE: An admonition draws the reader's attention to auxiliary information.

Here are the other built-in admonition types:

IMPORTANT: Don't forget the children!

TIP: Look for the warp zone under the bridge.

CAUTION: Slippery when wet.

WARNING: The software you're about to use is untested.

IMPORTANT: Sign off before stepping away from your computer.



=== Example 61. Admonition block
[NOTE]
====
An admonition block may contain complex content.

.A list
- one
- two
- three

Another paragraph.
====


== More delimited blocks
Any block can have a title, positioned above the block. A block title is a line of text that starts with a dot. The dot cannot be followed by a space.


=== Example 62. Sidebar block
.Optional Title
****
Sidebars are used to visually separate auxiliary bits of content
that supplement the main text.
****



=== Example 63. Example block
====
Here's a sample AsciiDoc document:

----
= Title of Document
Doc Writer
:toc:

This guide provides...
----

The document header is useful, but not required.
====



=== Example 64. Blockquotes
[quote, Abraham Lincoln, Address delivered at the dedication of the Cemetery at Gettysburg]
____
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation...
____

[quote, Albert Einstein]
A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.

____
A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.
____

[quote, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, 'Mathematician and author, also known as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll[Lewis Carroll]']
____
If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there.
____

"I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing,
and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."
-- Thomas Jefferson, Papers of Thomas Jefferson: Volume 11



=== Example 65. Open blocks
--
An open block can be an anonymous container,
or it can masquerade as any other block.
--

[source]
--
puts "I'm a source block!"
--



=== Example 66. Passthrough block
++++
<p>
Content in a passthrough block is passed to the output unprocessed.
That means you can include raw HTML, like this embedded Gist:
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mojavelinux/5333524.js">
</script>
++++



=== Example 67. Customize block substitutions
:release-version: 2.4.3

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId>
  <artifactId>asciidoctorj</artifactId>
  <version>{release-version}</version>
</dependency>
----


== Tables

=== Example 68. Table with a title, two columns, a header row, and two rows of content
.Table Title
|===
|Column 1, Header Row |Column 2, Header Row 

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|===
Unless the cols attribute is specified, the number of columns is equal to the number of cell separators on the first (non-empty) line.
When an empty line immediately follows a non-empty line at the start of the table, the cells in the first line get promoted to the table header.



=== Example 69. Table with two columns, a header row, and two rows of content
[%header,cols=2*] 
|===
|Name of Column 1
|Name of Column 2

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|===
The * in the cols attribute is the repeat operator. It means repeat the column specification across the remaining columns. In this case, we are repeating the default formatting across 2 columns. When the cells in the header are not defined on a single line, you must use the cols attribute to set the number of columns in the table and the %header option (or options=header attribute) to promote the first row to the table header.



=== Example 70. Table with three columns, a header row, and two rows of content
.Applications
[cols="1,1,2"] 
|===
|Name |Category |Description

|Browser
|Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.
It's designed for standards compliance,
performance, portability.

|Arquillian
|Testing
|An innovative and highly extensible testing platform.

|===
In this example, the cols attribute has two functions. It specifies that this table has three columns, and it sets their relative widths.



=== Example 71. Table with column containing AsciiDoc content
[cols="2,2,5a"]
|===
|Firefox
|Browser
|Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

It's designed for:

* standards compliance

== IDs, roles, and options

=== Example 77. Shorthand method for assigning block ID (anchor) and role
[#goals.incremental]
* Goal 1
* Goal 2

TIP: 
To specify multiple roles using the shorthand syntax, delimit them by dots.
The order of id and role values in the shorthand syntax does not matter.


=== Example 78. Formal method for assigning block ID (anchor) and role
[id="goals",role="incremental"]
* Goal 1
* Goal 2

=== Example 79. Explicit section ID (anchor)
[#null-values]
== Primitive types and null values

=== Example 80. Assign ID (anchor) and role to inline formatted text
[#id-name.role-name]`monospace text`

[#free-world.goals]*free the world*

=== Example 81. Shorthand method for assigning block options
[%header%footer%autowidth]
|===
|Header A |Header B
|Footer A |Footer B
|===

=== Example 82. Formal method for assigning block options
[options="header,footer,autowidth"]
|===
|Header A |Header B
|Footer A |Footer B
|===

// options can be shorted to opts
[opts="header,footer,autowidth"]
|===
|Header A |Header B
|Footer A |Footer B
|===

== Comments

== Escaping substitutions

=== Example 88. Backslash
In /items/\{id}, the id attribute isn't replaced.
The curly braces around it are preserved.

\*Stars* isn't displayed as bold text.
The asterisks around it are preserved.

\&sect; appears as an entity reference.
It's not converted into the section symbol (&sect;).

\=> The backslash prevents the equals sign followed by a greater
than sign from combining to form a double arrow character (=>).

\[[Word]] is not interpreted as an anchor.
The double brackets around it are preserved.

[\[[Word]]] is not interpreted as a bibliography anchor.
The triple brackets around it are preserved.

The URL \https://example.org isn't converted into an active link.



=== Example 89. Single and double plus inline passthroughs
A word or phrase between single pluses, such as +/user/{id}+,
is not substituted.
However, the special characters like +<+ and +>+ are still
escaped in the output.

An attribute reference within a word, such as dev++{conf}++,
is not replaced.

A plus passthrough will escape standalone formatting marks,
like +``+, or formatting marks within a word, like all-natural++*++.



=== Example 90. Triple plus inline passthrough and inline pass macro
+++<u>underline me</u>+++ is underlined.

pass:[<u>underline me</u>] is also underlined.


== Bibliography

=== Example 91. Bibliography with inbound references
_The Pragmatic Programmer_ <<pp>> should be required reading for all developers.
To learn all about design patterns, refer to the book by the "`Gang of Four`" <<gof>>.

[bibliography]
== References

* [[[pp]]] Andy Hunt & Dave Thomas. The Pragmatic Programmer:
From Journeyman to Master. Addison-Wesley. 1999.
* [[[gof,gang]]] Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson & John Vlissides.

== Footnotes

=== Example 92. Normal and reusable footnotes
A statement.footnote:[Clarification about this statement.]

A bold statement!footnote:disclaimer[Opinions are my own.]

Another bold statement.footnote:disclaimer[]


== Markdown compatibility
Markdown compatible syntax is an optional feature of the AsciiDoc language and is currently only available when using Asciidoctor.


=== Example 93. Markdown-style headings
# Document Title (Level 0)

## Section Level 1

### Section Level 2

#### Section Level 3

##### Section Level 4

###### Section Level 5



=== Example 94. Fenced code block with syntax highlighting
```ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/hi' do
  "Hello World!"
end
```



=== Example 95. Markdown-style blockquote
